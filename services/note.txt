I made these services to run the chat servers as their respective processes. 
This way I would not have to manually start each server instance upon reboot.
This also frees up the number of terminal windows that are needed to be open. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDITING THE SRC/MAIN.GO FILES

*In the respective src/go files, make sure you put the full path to its public folder

*Ex: I am running this on nginx, and store chatterbox in /var/www/, 
so I would make the public folder path (for the blue chat) "/var/www/chatterbox/chat-blue/public" 

*make sure to edit all the src/main.go files with their public folder's full location.


To make the services, you first have to compile the go files.
I am running linux, and I like to store completed apps in the /opt folder.
I have made a folder in the /opt folder for all the compiled programs to go. (mkdir /opt/chats)

I compiled the programs like so:

$ sudo go build -o /opt/chats/chat1 /var/www/chatterbox/chat-blue/src/main.go

This outputs the blue chat to /opt/chats/chat1.

Then I would compile the red chat:

$ sudo go build -o /opt/chats/chat2 /var/www/chatterbox/chat-red/src/main.go

and so on for however many chats that you have.

I edited and compiled all 4 original chat servers, now I have chat1,chat2,chat3,chat4 in my /opt/chats/ folder


-------------------------------------------------------
CREATING SERVICES

Ok now for creating the services.

Again, I am on linux, and have systemd. (This can be found on most common linux distros like Ubuntu)


For organization, I made a folder in /opt/chats/ called services.

If you have only edited the src/main.go files, and have not changed where you put the compiled programs, then simply follow along.
However I will explain what you should do if you have changed the folders where you compiled the programs.

For this project, in /opt/chats/services/, you can copy the services from chatterbox to the services folder:

$ sudo cp /path/to/chatterbox/services/* /opt/chats/services/

-----
If you changed the path to compile the src/main.go programs, then you need to edit the services.

*edit this line in each respective service (using blue as an example)

ExecStart=/opt/chat/services/chat1

edit this line to:

ExecStart=/full/path/to/your/chat1

-----

(Following the project)
Now copy thos services into systemd:

$ sudo cp /opt/chats/services/* /etc/systemd/system/

-----

(If you changed the location for the services)
copy them from their path:

$ sudo cp /full/path/to/services/* /etc/systemd/system/

-----

Since new files have been added to systemd, you need to reload the unit file definitions:

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Now enable each service:

$ sudo systemctl enable chat1.service
$ sudo systemctl enable chat2.service

and so on until every service is enabled.
Now, you can simply start your services:

$ sudo systemctl start chat1.service
$ sudo systemctl start chat2.service

You can check the status of your services:

$ sudo systemctl start chat1.service
$ sudo systemctl start chat2.service

Now your chat servers will start on boot and not require a terminal window to be constantly open.
